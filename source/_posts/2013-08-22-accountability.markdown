July was a cross-country road-tripping adventure vacation.  August has been a wash.  Now I'm back to talk about accountability.
</p>

<p>
All my life, I have been accountable to an authority that has given me my livelihood in return.  When I was younger, this was my parents, who gave me food and shelter.
At school, teachers and grades dictated my actions.
When I worked a previous jobs, this authority took the form of managers and annual reviews.
Clearly, now that I am working for myself and nobody else, this model of accountability must take on a new form.
</p>

<p>
Who tells me what to do? I do. As the receiver of my own directions, I must treat them with the full respect and importance that I would give to directions from a person of authority.
However, this also entails that I take on the role of manager and set up goals that will help myself succeed.  I should utilize the SMART model of goal setting to plan what I do.
</p>
 
<p>
If I am both the receiver and moderator of my own goals in a personally professional sense, how can there be full accountability?  In other words, how can I be checked against cheating on my own goals?
This is where I hope to leverage my community of friends and peers, through a public portal such as this blog, to give me accountability.  By putting my own progress under public scrutiny, can I be goaded into achieving more than ever?
