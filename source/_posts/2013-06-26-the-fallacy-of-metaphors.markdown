People seem to enjoy using metaphors as evidence for ways to live their lives.
For example, let's say Bob was described as a lion in the business world.
Perhaps he performed with great poise and leadership at the company meeting and was awarded with such lofty praise.
However, in characterizing Bob with a lion's personality, it is all too easy to associate other lion-like traits with Bob, whether he displays them or not.
People around him may begin to think that he is the top of the food chain, voraciously insatiable, or regal in nature.
Is he any of these things?  We don't know.  Maybe it would have been more accurate of a metaphor to call his poise and leadership dolphin-like.

The point is that in relating a subject with a metaphorical depiction, we build associations of ideas that may not be accurate to the original subject.
To generalize, if 'A' is figuratively like 'B' and 'C' is figuratively like 'D', just because in the metaphor of 'B' and 'D' there is a certain relationship, we need to be careful to say that the same relationship exists between 'A' and 'C'.
Use your metaphors carefully.  They are like guns.
