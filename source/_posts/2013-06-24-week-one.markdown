<p>
This week is my first attempt at independent, focused, self-promoting work.
As such, I have set a goal to log a total 55 work hours, which I hope to break up as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>30 hrs, heads-down coding, product design, project work</li>
    <li>5 hrs, organization and planning (ideally 30 minutes at the start and end of each day)</li>
    <li>5 hrs, reflection and updating this blog</li>
    <li>10 hrs, reading, learning, and staying up to date</li>
    <li>5 hrs, flexible time</li>
</ul>

<p>
This morning, I was able to get started on the personal website that I have always been meaning to create.
The website is being built on Rails to support future functionality, with Susy/Compass as the CSS framework.
Hopefully, I will be able to flesh out some of the pages for the site this afternoon.
As Tank from 'The Matrix' said, "If you are, it's a very exciting time."
